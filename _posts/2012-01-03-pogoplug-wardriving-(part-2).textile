So, I've discovered an issue with my GPSD + NTPD setup: It refuses to set the time on start, because the time is too far off (now doesn't that just suck!).  So, I needed to find a way to set this automatically, using the data from GPSD.  This really only needs to be run once, then I can trust NTPD to keep things up to date.  I found "this script":http://charlescurley.com/blog/articles/gpsdate_get_the_date_from_a_gps_receiver/index.html , however setting it up requires installing HALF OF CPAN.  So, I came up with a really awful hack to do this instead:

{% highlight bash %}
GPSDATE=`gpspipe -w | head -10 | grep TPV | sed -r 's/.*"time":"([^"]*)".*/\1/' | head -1`
echo $GPSDATE
date -s "$GPSDATE"
{% endhighlight %}

So, my rc.local looks like this now:

{% highlight bash %}
date -s '01/01/2011 00:01'
sleep 1
/usr/sbin/gpsd /dev/ttyUSB0 -n
sleep 6
GPSDATE=`gpspipe -w | head -10 | grep TPV | sed -r 's/.*"time":"([^"]*)".*/\1/' | head -1`
echo $GPSDATE
date -s "$GPSDATE"
sleep 3
/usr/bin/ntpd
{% endhighlight %}

It seems that you need the time to be somewhat close before you can get accurate results from GPSD.  Being in the same decade seems to help.
