title: Fixing Could not open device at /dev/ipmi0 or /dev/ipmi/0 or /dev/ipmidev/0
---

We are using a bunch of new Dell c6620 machines at work.  On Linux we were experencing some errors when trying to use ipmitool/ipmiutil to export IPMI controller information:

<pre class="highlight">

FRU Device Description : Builtin FRU Device (ID 0)
Could not open device at /dev/ipmi0 or /dev/ipmi/0 or /dev/ipmidev/0:
No such file or directory
Device not present (No Response)

Could not open device at /dev/ipmi0 or /dev/ipmi/0 or /dev/ipmidev/0:
No such file or directory
Get Device ID command failed

</pre>

It turns out that CentOS 6 doesn't seem to load any of the IPMI kernel modules by default, so this device does not exist.  Just load the modules with the following and everything should work properly:

{% highlight bash %}
modprobe ipmi_msghandler
modprobe ipmi_devintf
modprobe ipmi_si
{% endhighlight %}
