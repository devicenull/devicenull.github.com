title: RTLSDR SmartNet
---

I recently purchased a few RTLSDR devices.  The town where I live has uses a Motorola SmartNet II trunking system for it's police, fire, and EMS radios.  I've been able to receive the audio using a combination of SDR# and Unitrunker, but the specific version of SDR# needed is pretty old.  The original author of the modified version of SDR# seems to have developed a plugin for SDR# that does the same thing, but he never released it.  He did "release the source":https://www.assembla.com/code/sdrsharp/subversion/nodes/1132/branches/bobrich/AutoTunerPlugin to it, and I was able to compile it.

So, with my compiled version, you can copy the plugin to the latest development version of SDR#.  This lets you use all the newer versions of SDR# with the Trunking features.  You can download the binaries <a href="/files/sdrrelease.zip">here</a>.  There is one issue here, the code expects that you have a C:\Temp directory, and will crash on launch if this directory doesn't exist.
